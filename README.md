## ðŸ§  Key DAX Measures Used

1. **Average Loan Amount by Employment Type:**
    ```DAX
    AvgLoanAmount = AVERAGE(LoanData[LoanAmount])
    ```

2. **Default Rate by Employment Type:**
    ```DAX
    DefaultRate = 
    DIVIDE(
        CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(LoanData), LoanData[Loan_Status] = "Defaulted"),
        COUNTROWS(LoanData),
        0
    ) * 100
    ```

3. **YOY Loan Amount Change:**
    ```DAX
    YOYChangeLoanAmount = 
    VAR CurrentYearLoan = SUM(LoanData[LoanAmount])
    VAR LastYearLoan = CALCULATE(SUM(LoanData[LoanAmount]), DATEADD(LoanData[Date], -1, YEAR))
    RETURN
    DIVIDE((CurrentYearLoan - LastYearLoan), LastYearLoan)
    ```

4. **YOY Default Change:**
    ```DAX
    YOYChangeDefault = 
    VAR CurrentYearDefaults = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(LoanData), LoanData[Loan_Status] = "Defaulted")
    VAR LastYearDefaults = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(LoanData), LoanData[Loan_Status] = "Defaulted", DATEADD(LoanData[Date], -1, YEAR))
    RETURN
    DIVIDE((CurrentYearDefaults - LastYearDefaults), LastYearDefaults)
    ```
