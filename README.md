## ðŸ§  Key DAX Measures Used

1. **Default Rate by Year:**
```DAX
Default Rate by Year = 
VAR totalloans = 
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Loan_default'), ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', Loan_default[Year]))
VAR default = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(
            FILTER('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[Default] = TRUE())
        ),
        ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', Loan_default[Year])
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE(default, totalloans) * 100
```

---

2. **Loan Amount by Purpose:**
```DAX
Loan Amount by Purpose = 
SUMX(
    FILTER('Loan_default', NOT(ISBLANK('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]))),
    'Loan_default'[LoanAmount]
)
```
